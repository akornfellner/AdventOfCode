# Advent of Code Solutions
This project has solutions for the puzzles of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website written in Rust.

### Aims
This code is written to practice programming with Rust.
There is no guarantee that the offered solution is the best one.
I tried to use as few offered crates as possible and create all data structs on my own.
